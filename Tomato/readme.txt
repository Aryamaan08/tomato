This is a language I'm creating.
Tomato is a language that's different, yet related.
Tomato was designed to be easy, yet strong.
Tomato is a duplicate JavaScript xD
I made it because I was bored and I JUST WANTED TO DO SOMETHING, OKAY?
So, please give me feedback on how Tomato can improve.
Thank you.
